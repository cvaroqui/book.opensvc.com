## Keyword `url`

	required:    false

**Example:**

	url=https://collector.opensvc.com

**Description:**

The url of the OpenSVC Collector v3. The node feeds it, and reaches its
server api, when the node is registered on it.

The url of each api is derived from this one by appending its path, unless
set by its own keyword:

* `collector.feeder` defaults to `<collector.url>/feeder`
* `collector.server` defaults to `<collector.url>/server`

For example, with `url = https://collector.opensvc.com`, the node feeds
`https://collector.opensvc.com/feeder` and calls the server api at
`https://collector.opensvc.com/server`.
